	 		This is the McLaren 600 Lt. Clearly one of my favourite car. It's also a twin-turbo V8 but it makes "only" 600 horsepower. She has 620 newton meter of torque, a weight of 1356 kg and she is a track beast. She can do the 0 to 100 km/h in 2.9 sec and can reach 328 km/h.

This car has a naturally aspirated flat 6 engine which creat 520 horsepower and devellop 460 newton meter of torque. She does the 0-100 km/h in 3.9s and can reach 315 km/h. I clearly love this car.
